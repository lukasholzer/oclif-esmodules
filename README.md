# This is an example of oclif with ESModules

This should prove that going forward with oclif and ESModules is no option.

1. Run `./bin/run.js hello` and you should see an obfuscated error. 
2. Go to `/src/utils/other.js` and fix the file
3. Rerun and it will work.
4. Produce any issue and you will always get the same error message
